"""Fill gaps the page crawl missed, then research the product.

This runs only when brand, barcode, product name, a product image, or buyer
feedback is missing, or when product research has not been stored yet. It uses
the OpenAI Responses API with web search across the public web. The crawled
URL identifies the product and is not the only page searched. A barcode is a
GTIN, UPC, or EAN. It also searches for one or two public videos about the
product using the brand, name, and UPC. The answers are written onto the same
